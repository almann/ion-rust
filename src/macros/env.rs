//! The environment APIs for macros.
//!
//! These are the *"aggregate"* types to represent things like the type environment for a macro
//! or the macro environment for E-expressions.  As such, these container types are generally
//! generic to support static typing cases (i.e., semantic analysis of the macro), but also
//! run-time use cases where the environment points to the actual instance of the macro.
//!
//! The preference *within* macro definitions are to generally replace all macro invocations
//! with direct pointers (or offset indirections) to the compiled macro.  However, with
//! E-Expressions we may have to interpret a macro invocation on the fly from its textual name
//! (i.e., text), so these generic representations help in that context.
//!
//! These data types are implemented as [*persistent data structures*][1], so we can incrementally
//! build up the environments/modules/tables and have immutable views at each step and
//! retain/close over those environments for each macro definition.
//!
